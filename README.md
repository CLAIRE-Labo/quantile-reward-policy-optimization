- 🧠💻📊 _All the scripts we used to train and produce all the results presented in the paper (including reference data generation, training, and plotting)._
- 🛠🏗️⚙️ _All of our infrastructure and experiment management code for running and managing (tracking failures, etc.) experiments at scale on a SLURM cluster._
- 📦🐍🔒 _A reference implementation for a scalable code sandbox on SLURM clusters with container runtimes, which does not require elevated privileges._

_At the end of the day, it boils down to this:_
```python
def qrpo_loss(beta, logps, ref_logps, rewards, ref_rewards):
    """Compute the QRPO loss for a batch of prompts.
    Args:
        beta (`torch.Tensor: (1,)`):
            The beta parameter for the QRPO loss.
        logps (`torch.Tensor: (batch_size,)`):
            Log probabilities of the training completions for the model.
        ref_logps (`torch.Tensor: (batch_size,)`):
            Log probabilities of the training completions for the reference model.
        rewards (`torch.Tensor: (batch_size,)`):
            Rewards of the training completions.
        ref_rewards (`torch.Tensor: (batch_size, num_ref_rewards)`):
            Rewards of the reference completions generated by the reference model.
    Returns:
        loss (`torch.Tensor[batch_size]`): The computed QRPO loss.
    """
    log_ratios = logps - ref_logps
    quantile_rewards = (ref_rewards <= rewards.unsqueeze(dim=1)).float().mean(dim=1)
    log_Z = torch.log(beta) + 1 / beta      # numerical simplification (Eq. 11)
    loss = (quantile_rewards - beta * log_Z - beta * log_ratios) ** 2
    return loss
